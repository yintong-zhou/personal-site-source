                    I have a strong foundation in C#, which I use extensively for both console and web application development, particularly with the MVC framework. My front-end skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with proficiency in jQuery and Bootstrap for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. On the backend, I'm skilled in SQL for database management, ensuring efficient and optimized data handling.

                            Recently, I've been working on designing and developing web applications using ASP.NET MVC with C#, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I've also been enhancing my database management skills with Oracle PL/SQL, developing efficient stored procedures, functions, and packages.<br />
                            Collaboration has been key, and I've been working closely with cross-functional teams, contributing technical insights and participating in code reviews. <br />
                            Additionally, I've focused on testing and quality assurance to ensure we deliver high-quality software. It's been a rewarding experience, and I can't wait to see where it leads.

                            Our mission is to create a community of people, united by a strong interest and sense of belonging to China and Italy, who are interested or have already begun to pursue a professional career.
                            The network promotes active dialogue and serves as a point of contact between students, companies, professionals and job opportunities.<br />

                            We strongly believe in the importance of education, culture, study, diversity and respect.
                            By following these principles, together with the specific skills and the mastery of Italian, Chinese and English languages, we place ourselves in the world of work in Italy, China and the rest of the world.<br />
                            At present, there are about 2000 members in the network: university students, high school students, and professionals who share the interest to continue with the University and people who have already at least achieved a university degree in Italy, with Chinese origins or excellent knowledge of Chinese language and culture as well as Italian.

                            I've been developing background services and console applications with C# and .NET Framework, and building backend web apps using ASP.NET and MVC. Managing and querying databases with SQL Server and PostGres has been fascinating.<br />
                            I've also installed and configured Windows Server systems (2008-2019), and set up Redbox Voice recording software. Understanding and implementing VoIP systems has been quite interesting too.<br />
                            Lastly, I've been exploring virtual machines with VMWare Workstation, which has opened up new possibilities.<br />
                            I've really enjoyed these experiences and learned a lot. What have you been up to lately? I'd love to hear about your projects!

                            I've been learning and developing C# WinForm and services, which has been great for building Windows applications. <br />
                            I've also started using the Wireshark tool for network analysis, which is fascinating for observing data packets.  <br />
